Given N integers and K, find the minimum number of elements that should be removed such that Amax-Amin<=K. After removal
of elements, Amax and Amin is considered among the remaining elements.
Examples:

Input : a[] = {1, 3, 4, 9, 10, 11, 12, 17, 20} 
          k = 4 
          Output : 5 
          Explanation: Remove 1, 3, 4 from beginning 
          and 17, 20 from the end.

          Input : a[] = {1, 5, 6, 2, 8}  K=2
          Output : 3
          Explanation: There are multiple ways to 
          remove elements in this case.
          One among them is to remove 5, 6, 8.
          The other is to remove 1, 2, 5
